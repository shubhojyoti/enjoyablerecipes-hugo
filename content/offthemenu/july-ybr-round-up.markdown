July was a comparatively better month for us in terms of blogging. We posted more recipes. We also followed more food communities and blogs and found some wonderful new recipes. As I have been doing since April, I submitted one of my recipes in the "Your Best Recipe" section over at the [Spicie Foodie Blog](http://www.spiciefoodie.com). Hope you enjoy the Round up of mouth watering recipes.
