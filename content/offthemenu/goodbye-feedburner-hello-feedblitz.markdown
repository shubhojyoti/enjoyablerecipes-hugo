title: Goodbye Feedburner, Hello Feedblitz
---

With multiple news about [feedburner ](http://www.socialfish.org/2012/08/why-how-and-when-to-quit-feedburner.html) stopping service, I've decided to take the plunge and move out of Feedburner. The feeds from Enjoyable Recipes will now be served via Feedblitz. To all my few but loyal RSS readers, if you were subscribed at the feedburner URL, please update the subscription URL to http://enjoyablerecipes.net/feed/ If you are unsure of the URL to which you subscribed to, simply drop and re-add the feed so that the URL stays current. The email subscribers have been moved on to Mail Chimp and will receive weekly digests.
