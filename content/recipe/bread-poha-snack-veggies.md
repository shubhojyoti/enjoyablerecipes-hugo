Well its been a long time and we have not added any recipe. One of the reason being Sumi and me being on a low-carb diet. Since its really a challenge to do it in Indian cuisine leave alone Bengali, we had to invent lots of dishes. I mean not invent but rather bend them to our tastes. One of the major problems of a low carb diet is what everyone calls a carb crash. Its just a good way of saying I canâ€™t take it anymore. Well we had it too. And when we had it one such day we thought of having our all time favourite snack. There are various ways of making Poha. But we prefer having it with Bread, the reason being its easy to make. Oh and did I say it was tasty :D

"Curry leaves - 12 (approx)"
"Chat masala powder (or Kitchen King) - 1 tsp"
"Groundnut oil - 1-2 tbsp (enough for cooking but not stick to pan)"

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Crumble the bread into medium sized pieces and sprinkled with water to soften."

"Heat oil in a wok and fry the groundnuts till golden brown. Remove the groundnuts and keep aside."

"In the same oil, put the mustard seeds and wait for all of them to splatter."

"Add curry leaves, fry for few seconds then add the green chillies and onions."

"Add the chat masala or kitchen king masala (you can find these at any Indian store)."

"Add the bread pieces (after crumbling and softening with water as mentioned above), mix them with the remaining ingredients and then add salt and the fried groundnuts. Dont heat for long else the breads will stick to the wok."

"Remove from heat. Mix everything well."

"You can make it more interesting by adding boiled potatoes and peas too. Serve hot." >}}
