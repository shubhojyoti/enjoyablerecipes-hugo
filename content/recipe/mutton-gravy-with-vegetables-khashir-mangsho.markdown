My mom cooks wonderful mutton. Khashir Mangsho (Goat meat) is a popular delicacy in Bengal and is especially served during festivals. During our Durga Puja festival, on the Maha Ashthami (eighth day), Boomboom’s side of the family definitely have this dish. The gravy is turned healthy by adding loads of vegetables. These add great flavor into the dish. I have such fond memories of childhood. During the rainy days, I used to get so excited when I returned from school to a hot meal of plain rice and mutton gravy. I miss those days.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Finely chop the onions. Make a purée of the tomatoes. Grind a part of the onions and garlic and create a paste."

"Cut the potatoes (into 4 big pieces), the raw papaya (into 6 pieces) and the radish (into 8 pieces). Finely chop the capsicum. Coat the potatoes in salt and turmeric."

"Wash the meat nicely. In a pressure cooker, add the meat, some chopped onions, salt, half of the oil and 1/2 cup water. Put this on the gas, cover the pressure cooker and wait for 5-6 whistles. Switch off the gas."

"In a wok, add the remaining oil. Fry the potatoes till brown and keep it aside. Now fry the radish, capsicum and bay leaf. Keep aside. In the same oil, add the remaining sliced onions and fry till golden color. Now add these fried onions in the pressure cooker. Add all the powdered spices, little salt, butter, curd and sugar. Add the ginger paste. In the wok, fry the onion-garlic paste and when properly fried add it to the pressure cooker."

"Switch on the flame and start frying the contents of the pressure cooker. Now add all the fried vegetables. Keep cooking the meat in its own water and oil in low flame, stirring at regular intervals. Wait till the oil separates."

"In a separate utensil, add little water and the corn flour. When the water gets warm add this mixture to the pressure cooker."

"Continue cooking in the cooker. When the water vaporizes, add the garam masala. Cover the pressure cooker and wait for 1 whistle. Remove from the flame."

"Wait for few minutes and remove the meat from the cooker and serve." >}}
