You know we realized that we have only one chicken recipe in our blog so far. This is surprising considering that we have chicken every other day. So I drilled down our archives and found so many delicious chicken recipe pics. But unfortunately neither Sumi nor me remember the recipes. So when Sumi cooked this simple recipe tonight, I just had to post it. This is the most common form of chicken we have had ever since the low carb diet started.

Those busy days when both of us return quite late from work, Sumi is too tired to cook properly and I, as usual, am too lazy to cook. During such evenings this quick recipe comes to our recipe. Guess what, even I cook this recipe deliciously. That should give you an idea.
