Fish is compulsory on the dining table of any bengali. We literally start our life with a fish preparation. And suffice to say I love it too. This recipe is not exactly mine or Boomboomâ€™s. It was made by my mother-in-law. Both my mom and mom-in-law make it a different and both taste heavenly. I wish one day I can say that for my own recipe. Though whenever I tried it Boomboom told its very good. But I have never believed him so far.

"Wash the fish, mix salt and turmeric powder together and apply it on each of the pieces. Let it marinate for 15 mins."

"Now shallow fry each of the pieces' both sides till they turn light golden brown. Set it aside."

"Add little oil in a wok, add the mustard seeds, green chillies, ginger garlic paste, onion, salt and chilli powder. Stir in high flame."

"Add around 50-100ml of water to the mixture and let it boil in high flame."

"Take around half of the curd (150gm), whip it light so that water doesn't go out of it and add it to the contents in the wok."

"Now add the fish to the wok and cook it in low flame for 1 min. Turn the pieces to the other side and repeat."

"Now put the remaining curd, add little bit sugar and salt. Make sure the curd remains thick so do not over cook."

"Lay the fish in a dish and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and 1tbsp of raw mustard oil." >}}
