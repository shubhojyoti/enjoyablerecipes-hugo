Ever since our low carb diet has kicked in, our egg consumption has exponentially grown. It helps that both Sumi and I love them. She surely can write 101 methods to prepare eggs. I think out of 5 working days during the week, we take eggs in lunch at work 3 days. After returning home in evening it even increases more. Eggs have very less carb content. But the cholesterol content is supposed to be very high. Especially the egg yolk. But I love them. The best way of having them is plain boiled eggs. But I love the fried ones better. I know its not healthy but I canâ€™t help it.

Last Wednesday, both of us had a severe craving for eggs in the evening and that too not simple boiled. I also wanted to have a bit of spices. So Sumi quickly put up this mashed egg recipe. The mashed eggs are very common all over the world but I loved the way she made this one. Especially that they were boiled mashed eggs. It was quite healthy and fulfilling. Hope you like it.
