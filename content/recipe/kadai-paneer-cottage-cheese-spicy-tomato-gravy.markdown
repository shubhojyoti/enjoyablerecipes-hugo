If you are a follower of this blog, you will know that paneer is one of my favorite ingredients. I love paneer as much as I love chicken. I always try to experiment with different paneer dishes. However I have rarely tried to create a well-known paneer dish like Kadai Paneer. Since today is our weekly vegetarian day, I wanted to cook a paneer dish. I looked through some cookbooks and decided on creating a Kadai Paneer. The way I cook from a cookbook is I jot down all the ingredients, read through the steps multiple times and then try to cook from memory. The result always turn out similar but never a replica of the original as I always miss or change some step. I loved the aroma and taste of this Kadai Paneer and Sumi loved it too (which is a rarity as she doesn’t like paneer that much).

> Kadai Paneer is a very spicy tomato gravy based dish. There might be multiple variations to the dish. The level of hotness of the dish will vary with the amount of spices you add. If you want to make it less spicy please reduce the amount of chillies and spices.
