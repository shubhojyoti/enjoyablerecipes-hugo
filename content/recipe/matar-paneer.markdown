Paneer remains my all time favorite. When I was a kid (I am not one now despite what my mom wants me to believe), mom always made a paneer dish once a day. Lunch always used to contain fish, which is obvious as we were a typical Bengali family, but on Saturdays it was no fish. Instead we had a paneer dish. As far as I was concerned for me it made no difference. I loved fish, chicken and paneer equally. In fact some days when we had leftovers, I had to select between paneer or chicken and it used to be a very difficult decision indeed. So it is no surprise that when we visit Kolkata these days (that too once a year), paneer is an important ingredient in momâ€™s dishes. In fact this time when we visited, she made 4 different paneer dishes. Yummy!!

So today I am posting one of those 4 dishes. It is a classic in North Indian cuisine. Bengalis, however, have paneer usually in other forms. But my mom loves to make paneer with peas. And I just love the dish. Hope you all enjoy it too.
