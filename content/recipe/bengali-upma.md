excerpt: Boomboom is not well today. So I wanted to cook something light for him with very less oil. Upma is traditionally a south Indian dish but other communities also have their own versions of the dish. The style that I will talk about today is the Bengali version. Boomboom surely liked it. Hope you all enjoy it too.

Boomboom is not well today. So I wanted to cook something light for him with very less oil. Upma is traditionally a south Indian dish but other communities also have their own versions of the dish. The style that I will talk about today is the Bengali version. Boomboom surely liked it. Hope you all enjoy it too.

#### Ingredients

{{< recipe-ingredient-list
"Semolina (Sooji/Rava) - 100gm"
"Cauliflower (chopped into very small pieces) - 1 cup"
"Capsicum (sliced into small pieces) - 1/2"
"Potato - 1 medium sized sliced thin"
"Onion - 1 big sliced thin"
"Green chillies - 2 sliced to thin pieces"
"Ginger julienne - 1 tsp"
"Big Mustard seeds - 1 tsp"
"Vegetable oil - 1 tbsp"
"Salt - to taste" >}}

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Dry roast the semolina for 6-7 minutes in a non-stick wok till they turn light golden brown. Set it aside."

"Heat oil in a wok. Add ginger julienne, green chillies and onion and saute for 1 min."

"Add the remaining ingredients including capsicum and the potatoes and cook in medium flame till everything gets softened."

"Increase the flame, add the semolina and add equal quantity of water (maybe a little bit more) and stir till the water gets dried. Continue stirring in medium flame after this for few mins. Serve hot."

"You may add 1 tbsp fried peanuts while cooking too. This will give a much better flavour and taste. I didnâ€™t as Boomboom was sick."

"Enjoy experimenting." >}}
