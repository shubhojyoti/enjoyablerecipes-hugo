I guess Prawns are growing on me. I should credit Sumi for it. She cooked this awesome recipe today and I want more. The past few months I have not been able to strictly follow a completely low carb diet due to personal reasons. From today we have decided to get back into the regime again. We went to the market yesterday and got some fresh prawns and lots of fish. Today Sumi got up and the first thing she cooked was this prawn recipe. We had it for lunch along with some salad and it was awesome.

The recipe is essentially low carbohydrate but if you are trying to follow a diet regime with strict low carbs (somewhere under 20gms carb per day), then you will have to reduce the quantity of the spices from this recipe.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Marinade the prawn with all ingredients except the butter, coriander leaves and capsicum. Add desired salt in the marination. Mix well and refrigerate for 2 hours."

"Add butter in a wok, add capsicum and salt and fry till soft and little golden. Set the capsicum aside."

"In the same wok, add the gravy from the marination after taking out the prawns from it. Fry for 5 minutes in low to medium flame."

"Add the prawns to the gravy and keep stirring for around 4 minutes. Make sure you keep stirring else the cashew nut paste will get burnt in the bottom."

"Add 100ml water to the gravy, turn the flame to high and stir well. Cover the wok and switch to low flame and let it cook for around 5-6 minutes. Make sure you keep stirring in between to prevent burning. Also ensure that the prawns are not overcooked else they will become chewy."

"Now remove the lid, turn to high flame and keep stirring so that the watery gravy dries up. Now remove the wok from the heat and add freshly chopped coriander to garnish."

"Serve with parathas or rice. If you are on a low carb diet, have it with some salad." >}}
