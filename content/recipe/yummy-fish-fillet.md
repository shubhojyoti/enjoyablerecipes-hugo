This is going to be the final post of the year. We have not been regular with our posting this year too but things have picked up since November and I am happy for that reason. We are visiting our parents right now and we’ve been here since 24th and we will go back to Bangalore on 1st. Sumi is still following her diet (minus the first day when she just couldn’t resist Mom’s cooking). In contrast, I have simply decided to forget that I am on a low carb diet for these days. That means yummy sweets and wonderful dishes from one. I have requested mom to stay simple. I want to have simple home cooked meals. The result is a fabulous collection of 7 recipes so far in 4 days - not bad at all. And we have 4 full days left. All these recipes will come up on the site and trust me you will love them.

Back to the post, Sumi wants me to close the "[being](/recipe/tilapia-sorshe-dry/) [fishy](/recipe/macher-tel-jhol/)" series now. I have one more of the fish recipe from that day in my archives and it was another of those yummy ones that Sumi made. This time it was from the frozen fish fillets that we got from the Super market. I love this brand. It is called Ocean Fresh Fish Fillets. It tastes yummy even with a simple preparation. It has no fishy smell and its very clean. Hope you enjoy this recipe.

I would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy New Year. I look forward to 2012 and everything that the year has in store for me.

#### Ingredients

{{< recipe-ingredient-list

"Garlic paste - 1tsp"
"Ginger paste - 1tsp"
"Turmeric powder - 1/2tsp"

"Tomato (thin sliced) - 1"
"Lemon juice - 1tbsp"
"Vegetable oil - as required"
"Salt - to taste" >}}

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Marinade the fish fillets with salt, turmeric and lemon juice and set it aside for 15 min."

"In a non-stick pan, add vegetable oil sufficient to shallow fry the fillets. Now add the fillets and fry for 3-4 minutes in medium heat. Turn them after 2 min. Fish cooks in very less time. Take care not to fry too much as it will become flaky. Set aside the fried fish fillets."

"In the same pan, add coriander paste, cumin paste, red chilli paste, garlic paste and ginger paste.  Sauté for a min. Now add the sliced onion, leeks, tomato and sauté again for 2-3 minutes. Once the paste is fried just enough, you will get a good aroma of ginger garlic and oil separates from the paste."

"Now add the fillets back in the pan and add 80-100 ml of water and increase the flame. Coat the fish fillets with the gravy."

"You can make it more interesting by adding 100ml coconut milk instead of water."

"Serve hot with rice." >}}
