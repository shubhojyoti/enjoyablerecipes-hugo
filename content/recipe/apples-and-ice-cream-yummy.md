It’s been ages since we had ice cream. You obviously know why? Our Diet!! Sometimes we feel frustrated with the diet. Even a single day matters. Sumi had reached her target weight quite a few months back. Believe it or not but she lost a whopping 37kg since she started on the diet. But she is struggling now to maintain it. I, on the other hand, have lost around 12kg since the start which is horrible. I never followed the diet closely. But one thing that frustrates us is that even if we have carbohydrates one single day, it reflects on the weight negatively. And since we are already frustrated, we respond by having more yummy carb filled food LOL. But yes, we can safely attest that a low-carb diet works. In our case, it’s the only diet that has worked without making us mad with hunger.

So what does this have to do with ice cream. Well, in one such frustration filled day, we bought a tub of ice cream (Vanilla flavored of course since that’s my favorite). My parents were also here and my mom adores ice cream. In fact this is her only drawback in her otherwise healthy and disciplined diet. Now Sumi loves watching mom have ice cream which she eats slowly and enjoys every helping like a kid. So what Sumi did was make a fruit salad arrangement with the ice cream scoop as the centrepiece. It was a lovely dinner wink

Now this isn’t an ice cream recipe. It is just a salad arrangement cum decoration with ice cream.
