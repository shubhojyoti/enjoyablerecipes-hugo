This blog is getting “fishy”. By that I mean, like true Bengalis, the majority of the next few recipes will be fish based. Now mustard is a very tasty and essential ingredient in Bengali cuisine. And in our case, its a perfect match even during our diet. However the way it is prepared differs among various regions of Bengal - this is particularly visible in the cooking of our moms. Sumi, however, has learnt both the ways and she even has a version of her own. Today’s recipe is Sumi’s style of making the fish.

Sumi cooked this 3 months back. It was raining and we were hungry. Just a day back we bought quite a lot of fish from our favourite supermarket and being a weekend she planned to cook for the entire week woah That woman’s crazy. The problem is she’s my woman, so I sat through the whole ordeal oops. But all thing’s considered I had a yummy time. She cooked around 6 dishes, 3 fish ones, 1 chicken and 2 veggies. I am sure we took a pic of the whole spread. But I can’t find it right now. Anyways this is one of the fish ones. Its downright yummy.

> Sumi used Tilapia fish here. You can use any other fish you like instead like Rohu, Catla or Hilsa.
