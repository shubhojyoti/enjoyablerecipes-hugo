In our Indian cuisine, it’s very difficult to have any regular non-vegetarian curry without rice or bread. But ever since our low-carb diet begun, we have reduced our rice and bread intake by 90%. As a result, we always need to add some extra veggies (or fruits) or some other inventive cooking methods to have our chicken or fish curries. There was this time where we had slices of cheese (Mozzarella and Cheddar) along with chicken or the time when we grated Parmesan over the chicken.

Last week we went out to have sizzler and after many days I tried chicken sizzler over a bed of rice. So today Sumi decided that we will have the chicken curry over a bed of veggies. The only leftovers in our fridge were spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli and mushrooms. Okay that’s a lot. I didn’t realize that LOL. Anyway we selected asparagus and mushrooms. I sautéed the veggies and Sumi did the curry. You do realize I did the easier stuff don’t you? So here goes the recipe.
