Lately Sumi and I have noticed that our vegetable intake has reduced a great deal. Due to us following the low carb diet the easiest way has been blindly consuming chicken. The veggies which are best for our diet are mostly the premium ones in terms of price. Moreover Sumi hates almost all vegetables except potato. Especially when most of the time we can have just boiled veggies. As you guys might know, the wife is the “king” of the house so I just have never been able to force her to have more veggies.

But there has been a sudden change in her the past few weeks. She has told me that she is a bit fed up of having just chicken. She wants some other taste and have more vegetables. Yay!! So the past few days we have had quite a lot of veg preparations even though they are not purely Bengali styled recipes. The reason being less oil to be used and obviously reduced spices.

[Coccinia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinia_grandis) or Ivy Gourd or Kenduri (Bengali Name) helps in maintaining the blood pressure and reduces the sugar levels. To be honest, when just eaten boiled it tastes yucky. But its been a while we consumed it so Sumi decided to make a light fried Kenduri preparation with Capsicum to bring variety to it. It really refreshed our taste buds. The recipe details only the plain vegetable preparation. You can also add Paneer to it to bring more flavor which is what we did.
