Prawns (Chingri in Bengali) are an all time favorite of a typical Bengali. I guess I am the only exception. For some strange reason, I never took any fancy with them since childhood. I say strange because I have started to like them a little now, even though there are only few types of preparation that I like now. I had a friend in my class who once commented that no self-respecting Bengali can not like prawns. Well I think that makes me a self-loathing Bengali :p But I am not. Sumi, on the other hand, simply adores them. She always found it hard to believe that I dont like them. Around the time we started living together after I moved to Chennai after our marriage, I consciously tried to force myself to try few ingredients which I didnt like before. There were two reasons for it. One I didn't want to deprive Sumi of food items she loves. Second I wanted Sumi to have more of few vegetables which I love :D So prawns, mushrooms, spinach, carrot etc. became regulars in our diet. With the frozen, packed, cleaned up versions of prawns that we get nowadays in the super market, I have actually discovered my love for prawns. They are tasty and I just love them now.

This recipe in very common in Bengal and it is a favorite in any special occasions. Sumi has made it few times in the past 2 years and to tell you the truth, she really cooks this in an awesome manner. I have not told her this though *smile*
