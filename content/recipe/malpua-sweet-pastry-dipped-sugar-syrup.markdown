Things have been hectic lately. After many days of constant work, we found free time this weekend. Sumi and I were reminiscing our childhood and I remembered the delicious Malpuas that mom used to make for us. She made it specifically for me as I loved them. Even though we have been to Kolkata 4 times the past 3 years, I last had Malpua 4 years back. I consciously asked mom not to prepare them for the past few years due to our low-carb diet. Believe me they are so delicious, I cannot stop at 1-3. I devour them like a monster. Malpuas are famous in the entire North India. The only difference amounts to the usage of the syrup. Bengalis love it completely soaked in the syrup while the rest of the Northern states tend to have it dry. Hope you give it a try.

> The Recipe calls for Khowa. You can know more about making it [here](/recipe/khejuri-gurer-payesh-rice-pudding-jaggery-date-plum/). Also be ready for multiple attempts frying the pastry. The first few attempts might not give you the desired results. I am telling from experience.

#### Ingredients

**For the pastry**

{{< recipe-ingredient-list
"Coconut - 1"
"Semolina - 1 cup"
"Maida flour (Refined Wheat flour) - 2 cups"
"Rice powder - 1 cup"
"Sugar - 1.5 cups"
"Baking powder - 1/2 tsp"
"Khowa - 100gm"
"Milk - 1/2 litre"
"Bananas - 3"
"Sweet Fennel seeds - 1 tsp"
"Refined Sunflower oil - For deep frying" >}}

**For the sweetened syrup**

{{< recipe-ingredient-list
"Powdered sugar - 700gm"
"Water - 1 cup"
"Cardamom - 2 (small sized)"
"Rose water - For flavor (optional)" >}}

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Take all ingredients (except the fennel seeds) and blend it into a thick mixture."

"Add the sweet fennel seeds and mix well into the mixture."

"Heat oil in a wok. Using a large round spoon, take out the mixture and put it into the heated oil. Deep fry the mixture until golden brown. The spoon should be rounded so that we get the round shape of the pastry."

"In a separate utensil, add 1 cup water. Add the powdered sugar. Mix well to create a sweetened syrup (Chasni). Add 2 small cardamom pieces in this chasni."

"Soak the deep-fried pastries in the chasni. Keep them soaked for at least 5-6 hours (the more the better). You may also add a little rose-water for better flavor." >}}
