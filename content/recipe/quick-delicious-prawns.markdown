Due to our diet and erratic cooking habits we always try to find the fastest way to cook food - be it chicken, fish or prawns. Itâ€™s been quite a few time, Sumi cooked prawns with the shell on. To be frank, I have never been a huge fan of prawn, leave alone cooking it with the shell on. But Sumi was adamant this time and the result was fabulous. Not only did she cook it faster, the prawns were soft, moist and tasty. I am sure you all would love it too.
