Chutneys are a mainstay in Indian cooking. They bring out the flavors of any dish. They can be used as an appetizer, be an accompaniment with your main course or can even be used as a dessert. They can be sweet or a savory. The type and preparation of different chutneys has significant regional variations.

I love sweet chutneys. You can find one of my eternal favorites [here](/recipe/pancharangi-chatni-sweet-chutney-fruits-veggies/). Sumi loves the spicy varities more. She makes this awesome South Indian style red chutney. It is very spicy but the the flavor of each ingredients makes it a unique experience. She made this last Sunday and made enough to last us the entire week.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Cut the tomatoes into medium pieces and wash it properly to drain off all the seeds. Peel and cut the onion into medium pieces. Do not worry about making fine pieces. We will be making a paste anyway."

"De-seed the chillies by breaking them open into two pieces. Rub them and the seeds will fall off. Be careful with your eyes and hand. I used 4 red chillies and they may be too much hot for you. You can vary the numbers as per your taste."

"Crush the garlic cloves."

"Heat the oil in a pan."

"Add the black mustard seeds and sauté for a 3-5 seconds until you hear them pop. Now add the asafoetida and sauté quickly."

"Add all other ingredients - red chillies, garlic cloves, onion and tomato and sauté so that they are mixed well.  Be careful not to burn the red chillies or any ingredients as that will spoil the taste."

"Let it cook for about 4-5 minutes. Stir in between so that the contents do not stick to the pan."

"Remove the contents from the pan. Spread them on a plate and let it cool completely."

"Grind the contents in a mixer grinder."

"Pour into a container and serve it with dosa or idli."

"You can also spice it up by tempering it with mustard seeds and curry leaves. If you want to do so, take 1/2 tsp of oil, heat it separately in a pan, add 1/2 tsp black mustard seeds and 4-5 curry leaves. Spread it over the chutney." >}}
