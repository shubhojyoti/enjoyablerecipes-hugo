Sumi and I love Roast Chicken. However we always wanted to try and cook it ourselves. Alas all the recipes everywhere showed how to prepare it with the help on an oven. And since we live in a rented flat which doesn’t have the provision of an oven fitting, we are always at a loss. Everywhere we read, they said that Roast Chicken cannot be done in a microwave. So we finally decided to give it a shot anyways. Ultimately if it doesnt work we can always cook something out of it.

So with bit of this and that, we finally got it made. When Sumi ate it, she said it was the best chicken she ever made. Well I didn’t correct her. It was really awesome. So now we plan to bring home whole chicken whenever we get a chance. After all, practice makes a man perfect.
