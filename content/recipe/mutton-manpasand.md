Its been quite a while since we posted a recipe. The new year has been quite busy so far. Lots going on in our personal and professional lives. As a result we couldn’t experiment much with the food. Coupled up with our low carb diet, its safe to say that the new year has been a disaster in terms of food smiles However we did go to Calcutta in December/January and this time we made sure to pick up some recipes from our moms. So those will surely go up in this blog. Today we will share with you a mutton recipe, which incidentally is the first mutton recipe that Sumi has been satisfied about.

Mutton usually is part of regular diet at Calcutta. My parents love it a lot. I love it too but I prefer the home cooked mutton mostly. Due to our jobs it becomes very difficult to shop for mutton here in the area we live and weekends we usually get so lazy that we don’t travel much. So most of the time if we get the mutton it is from the Hypermarts where the muttons are pre-cut into cubes. Mutton usually takes more time and we 2 lazy bums don’t like to wait that long. However we took a chance and bought mutton again, this time from Spar Hypermart in Malleshwaram. And guess what it tasted awesome. Sumi really outdid herself. And it cooked quite fast too. Hope you enjoy it.

#### Method

**Marination**

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Marinate the mutton with curd, turmeric, grated onions, salt, ginger paste, garlic paste, mustard oil, Vegetable oil, sugarfree/sugar, half of red chilli paste and chopped tomato. Set it aside in refigerator for 1-2 hrs." >}}

**Preparation**

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Heat some oil in a wok, fry the capsicum for 1-2 min. Set it aside."

"Heat remaining vegetable oil in a pressure cooker, add cinnamon sticks, cardamom, bayleaf, squared onions, remaining ginger paste, garlic paste and green chillies. Fry for 3-4 minutes in medium to low flame. Now add the butter, cumin powder, coriander powder, meat masala powder and fry a little more."

"Now add the marinated chicken to it and add fried capsicum and half of chopped coriander leaves and cook slowly in low heat turning time to time. Take care that the gravy should not stick to the bottom of the cooker. Cook for 10 min - 15 min when gravy starts thickening. Now add the water to it and mix it well with gravy. Cover the cooker and let it whistle for 7 times in low heat. Mutton takes much longer time to cook."

"Let the pressure settle automatically, open the cooker and stir gently."

"Serve the mutton with rice or chapatti. Make sure to garnish it with remaining coriander leaves." >}}

Enjoy!!
