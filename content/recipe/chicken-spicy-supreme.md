I usually don’t post my own recipes here. Usually they have either been cooked by Sumi or our moms. This is always due to Sumi always having a modified and better version of my recipes. However the past few days we really wanted to try something different. Hence I decided to cook a very spicy chicken (spicy by our standards) by myself. As things would turn out, it actually tasted quite nice. Hope you like it too.

#### Ingredients

{{< recipe-ingredient-list
"Chicken - 800gm (curry cut)"
"Red chilli powder - 5 tbsp (add more to make it more spicy)"
"Cumin powder - 2 tsp"
"Garam Masala powder - 1 tsp"
"Ginger Garlic paste - 1 tbsp"
"Whole Cumin seeds - 1 tsp"
"Curry leaves - 9-10"
"Whole Green Chillies - 5"

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"In a mixing bowl, add the red chilly powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder and ginger garlic paste. Add around 4 tsp of oil. Now add the chicken to the bowl and mix well with the spices. Leave the chicken for around half an hour to marinate. The more you marinate, the better it is, but this is a quick recipe."

"In a pan, add the rest of the oil and heat it. Add the cumin seeds and curry leaves. Stir till the aroma of the leaves and cumin seeds come out. Brown each pieces of marinated chicken for around 2 minutes on both sides and keep it aside."

"Chop the onions and the half capsicum into thin pieces. Slit the green chilles in between. Now fry the onions, capsicum and the chillies till onions are golden brown and the capsicum is cooked."

"Now in a baking tray, add the fried chicken pieces along with the rest of the spices and sprinkle the fried vegetables over it. Preheat the microwave at 200 degrees in Convection Mode. Now bake the chicken for 20 minutes. Rest the chicken in the oven for 5 minutes."

"Now take the chicken out of the oven and serve it hot. Garnish with coriander leaves (we didn’t have it :p)" >}}
