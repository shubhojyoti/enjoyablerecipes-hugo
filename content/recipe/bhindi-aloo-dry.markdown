Bhindi is one of the most loved vegetables in India. There is a saying that people who love Bhindi are very intelligent. I figure that’s why I was never the top student of my class. It was really a hot day and Sumi was in her bad mood. So we went vegetable shopping and there was this set of Okra almost smiling at her (I think so) and Sumi got impressed by their smile (I think this too) because that instant she bought 500 grams of it. Yes my bad luck. This would be tonight’s dinner :( But to Sumi’s credit it actually ended up quite tasty.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Wash the Okras and cut the head parts off. Make a slit around the middle part of the Okras and keep it aside."

"In a big flat plate, mix all the spices together. Now add the okras and make sure each and every Okra has a proper coating of the spices. Set aside for few minutes to let it marinate well."

"In a non-stick wok, take around 2 tbsp of oil, add the slit onions, potatoes and tomato paste and mix well and stir in low flame for 2-3 minutes. Now cover the wok and let the potatoes cook in sim. Keep stirring in regular intervals. This allows very less oil to be used in this recipe."

"When the potatoes are half cooked add the marinated okras and stir in low flame."

"Cover the wok again and let it cook for around 10 minutes. Keep stirring at regular intervals till the Okras get soft."

"Once the okras are soft, take off the wok from the flame and serve hot." >}}
