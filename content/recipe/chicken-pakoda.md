Whenever it rains, it takes me back to my childhood. Both Boomboom and I grew up in the chilly Northern and Eastern India. Inherently, rains accompanied a severe drop in temperature. The perfect rainy evening consisted of crispy potato and chicken pakodas with coffee. Mom used to cook these frequently but they became tasted extraordinary on a rainy day. Our whole family would sit together and savor theses pakodas.

Since yesterday itâ€™s raining and the weather has also turned chilly. I had some chicken in my fridge. I decided to surprise Boomboom with a crispy chicken pakoda. They turned out really good. It felt nice sitting in the balcony and enjoying the snack along with watching the rain.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"In a pressure cooker, add the chicken. Add enough water to cover the chicken. Add 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp turmeric powder. Cover the lid and start cooking in high flame till 2 whistles. Cool it down in running water to reduce the pressure. Do NOT try to force open the pressure cooker."

"Take out the chicken pieces and let them dry. You may keep the remaining water which can be used as a stock in future."

"In a big bowl, add besan flour, carrom seeds, white sesame seeds, salt, ginger-garlic paste, red food color, pinch of baking soda, chilli powder, chopped onion, chopped green chillies, asafoetida and parsley or coriander leaves. Mix by adding water slowly and turn into a batter. The batter should be the right consistency wherein it is neither runny nor sticky. Make sure there are no lumps."

"In a deep wok, heat oil till hot (but not smoky)."

"Coat each piece of chicken in the batter and deep fry in the heated oil for 5-10 minutes till the coating turns crispy. Set aside on tissue papers to absorb the extra oil."

"Serve hot. You may serve it with coriander chutney or garlic dip." >}}
