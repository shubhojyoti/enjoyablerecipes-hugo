We love eggs. I guess post marriage the amount of eggs we have eaten is greater than my entire egg consumption before marriage. One of the primary reason being the simple manner in which we can cook it. Another reason being the various preparation we can have with them. Who would have thought a simple round thing can be so tasty yum Okay I am going way out of topic. The recipe I am sharing today is very simple and one of the most widely consumed snack in Bengal. Especially during the festive Durga Puja seasons, if you walk even 100 metres I am sure you will find at least 5-6 egg roll stalls.  I missed it this year as I couldnt visit Calcutta during the Durga Puja this year.

Back to the recipe, these egg rolls were made some 8 months back, we took the pic but I never got the time to post the recipe. Today as I was browsing my archives (yes I have an archive of my food pics and I stare at them no matter how bad we made it *wink*), I found this. To be honest, today is one of those days when I have got that “carb crash”, which I talked about in the previous post. Every time when we have this huge curb, we dont fall into the temptations and have breads and stuff. Sometimes I actually just look at the pictures of our past food excursions and that fulfills my desire. So that was what I was doing today and I got this one. Its very very simple to make. So here we go.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"Mix the refined flour, carrom seeds, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoon oil and milk and prepare soft dough. Add water if necessary."

"Divide the dough into medium sized balls and roll them with a rolling pin to make round like chapatti. Set it aside."

"Meanwhile, de-seed cucumber and cut into 2inch size thin julienne. Similarly cut onion and slit green chillies diagonally. Set them aside."

"Heat the chapatti in a non-stick pan frequently turning sides. Take care it should not turn brown. After a min, add a little oil on each side and turn it. Set it aside. (The chapatti should be soft and can be easily torn in pieces)"

"Beat one egg with 2-3 drops of lemon juice and a pinch of salt."

"Put little oil in the same pan and heat it, spread the egg mix and make a round shape omelette. Cook with sim flame so that the bottom does not burn and egg is cooked slowly. Do not turn the side. Now gently put the chapatti you have cooked before on top of omelette. Now turn both together on a plate (omelette should be in the inner side of roll and chapatti should be outer side)."

"Add the cucumber, onion, chilli juliennes, add rock salt, pinch of chat powder, tomato sauce, chilli sauce and carefully roll. Secure the ends by wrapping it with a butter paper. Use a toothpick to firm the central part."

"Repeat the same process for making more rolls."

"Serve with chutney/ketchup." >}}
