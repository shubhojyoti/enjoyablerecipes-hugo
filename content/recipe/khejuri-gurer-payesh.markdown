Bengalis are known for their sweet teeth. No matter what the occasion is, sweets are a compulsory portion of the menu. I remember indulging in all the lovely “Makar Sankranti” delicacies mom made like Pathisapta and Pithes. I also love Rasagullas, Sandesh and Langcha. The options are unlimited. However Payesh is considered one of the most auspicious sweet. During birthdays, anniversaries or any festivals, having a spoonful of Payesh is considered a very good start for the day. Payesh can be made using rice or other materials. When made with rice, it is basically a Rice Pudding. I love the Rice Payesh the best. The recipe I am posting today is by my mom and it is my favorite version of the pudding. Hope you like this typical Bengali dessert too.

#### Method

{{< recipe-prep-steps
"In a big utensil, boil the milk and remove half of it aside."

"Wash the rice, mix with ghee and add it to the boiling milk which is still in the utensil. The rice must be added in bits, each time stirring it finely and then letting the milk boil further to reduce it. Keep doing this till the entire rice has been added and mixed."

"Once the rice is mixed fully, add sugar and khowa to it. Keep stirring and when the milk reduces further add a little bit (around 5tbsp) of the milk that was set aside in the first step."

"Add the jaggery, half of the raisins and around 3-4 cashewnuts (after breaking them)."

"Mix well and let the milk boil further. As the milk keeps reducing, keep adding bits of the milk that was set aside before. Continue this till the entire milk is used up."

"When the entire milk gets boiled well and becomes rich and thick, take down the milk from the flame. Put aside."

"Garnish with the remaining raisins, cashewnuts and the cardamom powder."

"You may serve it hot or cool in the refrigerator and then serve."

"Serves 6-8 bowls." >}}

> Always add sugar before jaggery otherwise the milk might get spoiled.
